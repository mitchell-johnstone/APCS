Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs,Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes,Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers' tears.What is it else? A madness most discreet,A choking gall and a preserving sweet.Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.The courses of true love never did run smooth.It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.My bounty is as deep as the sea,My love as deep; the more I give to thee,The more I have, for both are infinite.
